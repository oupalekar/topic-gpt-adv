{"id":"alt.atheism-0","text":"Ideologies also split, giving more to disagree upon, and may also lead to intolerance. So do you also oppose all ideologies? I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature. I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me. One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence. Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals. I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls. Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven? Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)? I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying \"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\" says they have souls. (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then I have no idea _what_ a soul is.) As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority. That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam. Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought. It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message. In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you. I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be \"forgiven\" and \"rewarded\" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse). Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage. The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited. Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.","label":"alt.atheism","responses":"[1] Ideologies: Discussing the nature of human nature and

{"id":"alt.atheism-7","text":"I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read? Not much it seems. It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \"scientists\" would take note. (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics. For example, there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been accounted for. :-] ) Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people. Did Tony follow that one up? Millions of people have \"died for a lie\". This point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders. The list is endless. The Aztecs lost, BTW. That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian. More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \"real thing\". Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany? More to the point, did Tony mention this? One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues fools, or illogical men, their support of Hitler was based (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles. Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane.... Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\" This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible. The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present. If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit. Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless. For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\". That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct. It I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-). I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people. Someone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one rules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead. If I am pressed I could probably find the exact quotation.","label":"alt.atheism","responses":"[1] Trade: Mentions the exchange of capital, goods, and services.\n\n[1] Economics: The study of the
